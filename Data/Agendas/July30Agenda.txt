3. Next week's overview - In this section we discuss what the main plan
for next week is, based on where we stand now. Here we aim to establish, 
to some degree of precision, the steps we'll be taking in the upcoming week

Having entered the second half of our project, in this section we may also choose to address 
changes of directive for our project's goal, subject to the conclusions drawn from the previous
two sections.

4. Actions - This section covers any proposed actions/directions to take 
apart from the immediate project plan. This may include, but isn't limited to:
roles assignment, change of roles, change of tasks, personal engagements for the week,
