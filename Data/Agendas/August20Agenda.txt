3. Next week's overview - In this section we discuss what the main plan
for next week is, based on where we stand now. Here we aim to establish, 
to some degree of precision, the steps we'll be taking in the upcoming week 
both as a group, and in terms of individual contribution.
Following the first draft submission, in this section we will also tackle our 
current progress on improvements and modifications to the project write-up.

4. Actions - This section covers any proposed actions/directions to take 
apart from the immediate project plan. This may include, but isn't limited to:
roles assignment, change of roles, change of tasks, personal engagements for the week, 
changes in platforms (eg if members need to use a 3rd party program) etc. *

5. Other issues - This section covers anything else that needs saying.

6. Concluding statements and thanks.
