Agenda for 6th August meeting

1. Introduction -  This section covers where we stand at the moment in terms of the updated planning, 
as well as what the main focus of the week has been. The original planning has been abandoned as of 
2nd of August. The entire scope of current planning can be found at the bottom of this agenda.

2. Project members input:
    2.1 Luke  ] Team B* **
    2.2 Alex  ] Team B* 
    2.3 Gab   ] Team A*
    2.4 Matt  ] Team A*

* As per the planning, tasks have been equally split into two teams consisting of two members each:
team A and team B respectively.
** Luke has been moved up at the top of the project input list for this week as he may have to leave 
the meeting sooner than the rest of the members.


3. Next week's overview - In this section we discuss what the main plan
for next week is, based on where we stand now. Here we aim to establish, 
to some degree of precision, the steps we'll be taking in the upcoming week 
both as a group, as teams, and in terms of individual contribution.
Changes of direction have previously been established as per the 30th July meeting.
This issue will only return once/if need arises for another vote at changing the current plan.

4. Actions - This section covers any proposed actions/directions to take 
apart from the immediate project plan. This may include, but isn't limited to:
roles assignment, change of roles, change of tasks, personal engagements for the week, 
changes in platforms (eg if members need to use a 3rd party program) etc. *

5. Other issues - This section covers anything else that needs saying.

6. Concluding statements and thanks.



Note: Weeks with dual tasks are to be interpreted as Team A's tasks on the left side, and
Team B's tasks on the right side. When teams are working on separate issues, it is denoted by
Team A | Team B. When working together, it is denoted as either Team A & Team B or no explicit dual tasks formula.
