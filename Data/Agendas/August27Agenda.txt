Agenda for 27th August meeting


1. Introduction -  This section covers where we stand at the moment in terms of the updated planning, 
as well as what the main focus of the week has been. The original planning has been abandoned as of 
2nd of August. The entire scope of current planning can be found at the bottom of this agenda.

_Note: 'Project members input' section has been completely removed for the remaining meeting(s).
'Next week's overview' section has been changed. 'Actions' section has been changed._

2. Draft submission - This section is provisional for this week only. Here we aim to discuss
the current state of our write-up, particularly which points from the list of changes have
been crossed off and which haven't yet. Here we may also choose to discuss other
suggestions regarding the write-up, as well as individual opinions on its current state.

3. Next week's overview - In this section we discuss what the main plan
for next week is, based on where we stand now. Reaching the end of our project, in this
section we will mainly focus on criterias that haven't yet been met to ensure the process of
finishing up goes as smoothly as possible, such as: annotations, work ordering, presentation, 
visualisations, coherence, flow, grammar and crucially: state of the presentation. 

4. Actions - This section mostly covers personal engagements for the upcoming week. Other
actions may freely be brought up otherwise.

5. Other issues - This section covers anything else that needs saying.

6. Concluding statements and thanks.
