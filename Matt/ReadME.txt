All documents, present in either the main folder as such or in corresponding subfolders contribute towards the 'Advanced Cyber Analytics for Anomaly Detection' project and are exclusively the work of named contributor and his project colleagues. All extra material is adequately referenced and documented within these documents, wherever relevant. 

The files can be understood as independent works for the most part, but they are grouped based on the stages of the project they were used in. All files are meant to be read in the order indicated numerically within their folders, e.g. 1 - X, 2 - Y etc. The chronological (and advised) reading order for the folders is as follows:


0. Folder: 'Early Project Works' [OPTIONAL]

    This folder is leftover from work conducted before the commencement of the project - it references investiations conducted into other data sets and techniques and does not form an essential part of the project. The initial research document presents ideas on other data sets we considered while the IF Analysis is a brief look into the usability of Isolation Forests.
      

1. Folder: 'EDA'
    This folder contains the early investigations into the LANL dataset. It contains visualisations of process networks and investigation into features in the authentication data set. In the data reading techniques subfolder, we investigate data reading techniques for the WLS documents and look briefly at streaming techniques. This folder is crucial for further reference, as results drawn from the initial steps described within the corresponding files are later used in the second and third folders. 
    

3. Folder: 'Anomaly Detection'

    This subfolder contains all of my contribution towards performing the anomaly detection stage of the project. This folder forms the bulk of our enquiry into anomaly detection. The initial AD document discusses the early attempts we made including many which do not feature in the final report including HTM Studio, CP APR and Bipartite AD. The results from this are contained in the corresponding subfolder and demonstrate the usability of these techniques. The final anomaly detection folder contains the notebook that implements the final anomaly detection techniques used in this project along with an analysis of the results. The results are also given in this folder for ease of access.


4. Folder: 'Kill Chain'
